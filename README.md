The objective of this A/B test experiment is to make a recommendation on Udacity's course overview page.
<br>
<br>
**Before the experiment**, you had two options on the course overview page: "start free trial" and "access course materials".
If the student clicks **"start free trial"**, they will be asked to enter their credit card information, and then they will be enrolled in a free trial for the paid version of the course. After 14 days, they will automatically be charged unless they cancel first. If the student clicks **"access course materials"**, they will have access to the course content but will not receive any feedbacks.
<br>
<br>
**The experiment** consists in asking the following question if the students clicks "start free trial": How much time will you spend on this course per week? If the student writes 5 hours or more, then the student will access the checkout process as before. If the student indicates less than 5 hours, then he will receive a message telling him that this course requires usually at least 5 hours/week. At this point, the student would have the option to continue enrolling in the free trial, or access the course materials for free instead. Here is a [screenshot]

**The objective** of the experiment is to guide the students towards the offer matching their needs. For example, before the experiment, some students were getting frustrated because they couldn't spend enough time on the course and then had to pay while they couldn't really discover the content.
<br>
<br>
**Hypothesis**: 
The experiment should filter students with higher commitment in the "free trial". As a consequence, we should have a higher rate of students who started the free trial and completed it.
The experiment could also negatively affect the number of students choosing the free trial.
